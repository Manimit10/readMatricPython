# Read Matrix in Python
You should write a program that do: 

1- Find the list that contains ALL STRING and print them on the console on capital letters. 
For example program will not do anything with first and second array. but the 3rd array contains ALL STRING.
If an array contains string but there are other data types in array, your program will ignore it.
So the program will print 
```
BOOK 
MOSH 
ARC 
PHOTO
```
2- Find the list that all of its elements are numbers.
Then print the *prime numbers* that exists in the list in **reverse order**.


**VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:** During the test I will change the order of matrix. So your program should be able to find the proper array smartly.
Your prgram should be smart to find the list that contain all strings and all numbers.
